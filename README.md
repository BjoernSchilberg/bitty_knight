# Bitty Knight
This is the source for the first game I made with Go on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751370/Bitty_Knight/ using Go bindings for Raylib https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go
Be warned, I taught myself to code and therefore the code will look unconventional and probably bad to a lot of people.
