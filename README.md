***Be warned**, I taught myself to code and therefore the code is unconventional*.    

 It is free to play on Steam and works via Proton on Linux https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751370/Bitty_Knight/   

This is the source code for the first game I made with Go.  

Made with the Go bindings for Raylib https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go
